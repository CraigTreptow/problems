Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks
themselves by using escape characters.

## Example Output
> What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
> Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
> Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

## Constraints
* Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
* If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise.  Use string concatenation instead.
